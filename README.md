### What I Learned
While developing this application, I learned about Pods in iOS applications and how to install and utilize them. In Flix, I used Alamofire to make HTTP requests to The Movie Database API. Building Flix allowed me to get more experience using TableViews and CollectionViews. I was really fascinated with the power of TableViews and how designing a TableViewCell and implementing a few methods would populate the cells with the data properly. After working with TableViews, I realized how many applications that I use everyday are built with TableViews (i.e. tweets on Twitter, posts on Instagram, etc.).

**NOTE:** When cloning this application, there is one piece of information you must fill in in order to build and run properly. In a separate Swift file (i.e. Constants.swift), create 1 constant variable: APIKEY. The API key is used to retrieve information from The Movie Database API. After configuring this constant, you can successfully run Flix!
